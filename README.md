# Credit-Card-Fraud-Autoencoder

This repository uses an autoencoder to detect credit card fraud in a publically available dataset.  

The dataset itself is too large to upload to github but is available on [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/home#).
